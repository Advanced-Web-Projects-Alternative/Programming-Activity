Question: What kinds of functionality would it be better to do on the client side rather than on the server? 
The functionality that is better on the client side rather than on the server are types of things that do not need to be pulled from the server such as certain UI characteristics. The fact that a header should be bold or centered is something that is done on the client side. Furthermore, the group photo is not stored locally but is a link therefore, this should be on client side since it can be accessed from anywhere. A link connecting this page to the blog post should be on client side because it is only a link, the actual blog posts are in the database, therefore that is server-side but on client side you see the words that are clickable which will lead you to the serverside information.


What will your client side code look like?
Client side code is mostly dealing with the User interface of a website. Our blog website is pretty simple and the code is pretty dry sense it is well organized and separated between server side, database, and client side. Our client side focuses on the headers, titles, links that will give information from the serverside and database (this is how blogs appear). Also, We used a photo that is already on the internet so this is on the client-side since it does not need anything from a local computer.

What kind of POST requests would you have in your Blog CMS?
