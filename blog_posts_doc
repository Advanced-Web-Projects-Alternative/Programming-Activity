###Blog Post 1    Author:RGEN  Date:10/13/2019
This is the first blog post on the site. Welcome to the community! 
This is a place for students to gather to talk about UX design and being a student.
So grab your cup of coffee, pull up a chair, and get ready to discuss design.
We look forward to getting to know each other and are always open to new members.
